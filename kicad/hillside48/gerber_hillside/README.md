These PTH are mechanical not electrical:

- 2.5mm x 3 on the right, for haptic and trackball boards.
- 2.2mm x 8 in the center and sides, for a tenting puck and case mount
- 1.7mm x 1 in the bottom center, for a keyswitch that is also a rotary encoder mount.
   It is close to a the ground PTH for the rotary encoder, so it got converted to a PTH.
   Some joining of the two is fine.
